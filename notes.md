1) For a height of 1km, 
Time taken for echo = 1000 / 343 * 2
Which is more than 4 seconds
So horizontal displacement in this time is too big to ignore

Assumptions:
1) The radius of view of the ultrasound sensor is short, so we don't get interference from the sides of the buildings
2) The simulator need not consider the horizontal displacement, as data is random data anyway
